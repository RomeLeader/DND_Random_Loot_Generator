# DND_Random_Loot_Generator
A random loot generator for DND using simple switch cases and random numbers

[Version 1.5]

Tired of that lousy DM fucking up your initiative and missing your turn? Tired of having to find a pencil to write down
initiative or calculating it with all those numbers?

TIRE NO MORE

Introducing the handy, dandy DND INITIATOR 3000!!! Running on a shiny version of Google's Quicksort, this bad boy can
calculate initiative for you and 10 million of your best buds. It has log(n) complexity, so you know that shit's for real.

Source code included for benefit of the interested (Jeffrey).

Version Notes/Things to Fix:

Features:

* 6 player, 12 monster support
* Enter to scroll through list for current player
* # ENTER TWICE TO SKIP UNNEEDED MONSTERS/PLAYERS

Notes/Future Additions:

- Currently, ties are not resolved. Any tie is left alone, but eventually will be awarded to the player with the best Dex

- When you go up a level, I just need to make a quick change, but don't let me forget or you'll never have the right init.

- Anyone can input any number they want for a dice roll. Don't. I could fix this but it would be better to trust that
you'll just give sanitized input. Make sure to give a value. If you give nothing, the computer could assign
a huge random value instead, though it won't let you move on without a keystroke of some kind.
